- 1 device needs to become host, by selecting the option of Create Maze. User can select level and then given the Code that user can share it with another user in order to join the game.
- other device will select join game option and will be asked to enter the code that's been shared by Host.
- once the code is given, the game will start in both devices and the Host will become the Blue ball and other device will become (red ball)Ghost.
- target is still the same, Blue ball has to reach to goal and red ball has to stop it.
## Controls

- `up`, `down`, `left`, `right` keys: move
- can also use `w`, `s`, `a`, `d` keys for movement
- if you are playing in Mobile phone then you can tilt the device in the direction you want you player to move
- `space` key to use special ability(based on selected character)
- the red eye looking thing(sharingan) can also be used to activate the special ability (for Mobile Phones)
- the Special ability can be used only 3 time in each level and it needs 2 seconds to recharge (whenever the sharingan's looks faded that means you can not use special ability right now.)
